## **Overview**

**Tetris** is a puzzle game where the objective is to manipulate tetrominoes (blocks) to create complete horizontal lines, which are then cleared from the board. As the game progresses, the tetrominoes fall faster, increasing the difficulty.

This repository includes:
1. **Tetris Game**: A fully functioning Tetris game implemented in **Python** using **Pygame**.

## **Requirements**

To run the game, you will need to have **Python** installed along with the **Pygame** library.
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/tetris-game.git
   cd tetris-game
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

## **Usage**
1. **Run the Tetris game**:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## **Gameplay**
In Tetris, the player must rotate and position falling tetrominoes to form complete horizontal lines. When a line is completed, it is removed, and the player earns points. The game ends when the tetrominoes stack up to the top of the screen.
